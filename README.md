# github_actions_practice

The goal of this repository is to practice writing BackEnd yaml workflows that process FrontEnd user_input, using the run_GitHub_Actions repository and JavaScript functions in the library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html script.

The run_GitHub_Actions repository is a space where files are created, containing user_input, by way of using the JavaScript functions in the library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html script.

[Test the library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html script - Create a file named temp in the public repository run_GitHub_Actions] https://CodeSolutions2.github.io/github_actions_practice/library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html

[In progress] FrontEnd webapps with and without a popup window for inputting user_input.
