# github_actions_practice

The goal of this repository is to practice writing BackEnd yaml workflows that process FrontEnd user_input, using the run_GitHub_Actions repository and JavaScript functions in the [library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/github_actions_practice/blob/main/library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html) script.

The run_GitHub_Actions repository is a space where files are created, containing user_input, by way of using the JavaScript functions in the library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.html script.
